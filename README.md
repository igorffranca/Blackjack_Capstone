Gameplay Instructions  
At the start of the game, the dealer will deal two cards to you and two cards to themselves. One of the dealer's cards will be face-up, while the other will be face-down.  
You will be presented with your hand's value and the dealer's face-up card.  
Choose to hit (request an additional card) or stand (end your turn) based on your hand's value and the dealer's card.  
After you stand, the dealer will reveal their face-down card and draw additional cards until their hand's value is 17 or more.  
The winner will be determined based on who has a hand with a value closer to 21 without exceeding it.  
You can choose to play again or quit the game.  

Game Rules  
The objective is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.  
The value of numbered cards 2-10 is their face value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and the Ace can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is more advantageous.  
After the initial deal, you can choose to hit (draw another card) or stand (end your turn).  
If the total value of your hand exceeds 21, you go bust and lose the round.  
The dealer must hit until their hand's value is 17 or more.  
If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they go bust, and you win the round.  
If neither you nor the dealer goes bust, the hand with a value closer to 21 wins.
